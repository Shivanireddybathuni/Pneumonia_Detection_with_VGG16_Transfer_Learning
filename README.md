Hi Folks! Iâ€™m Shivani, currently pursuing my BCA from Nalanda Institute. I have a deep passion for data science and a strong grasp of machine learning algorithms. This project focuses on leveraging transfer learning with the VGG16 model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Project Overview
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening, especially in children and the elderly. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. In this project, we use transfer learning with the VGG16 model to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is organized into two folders:

train: Contains the training images, further divided into two subfolders: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.
test: Contains the testing images, also divided into NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.
What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on a large dataset is reused (in whole or in part) on a new task. The idea is to leverage the knowledge the model has learned from the initial task to improve performance on a different, but related, task. Transfer learning is particularly useful when you have limited data for the new task.

Implementing Transfer Learning with VGG16
VGG16 Model
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in their paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition." It is one of the most popular deep learning models and was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

Steps in Transfer Learning
Load Pre-trained VGG16 Model: We load the VGG16 model with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. The top fully connected layers are removed because they are specific to the original classification task (ImageNet).

Freeze Convolutional Layers: The convolutional layers are frozen to retain the features learned during the initial training on ImageNet.

Add Custom Layers: We add custom fully connected layers on top of the VGG16 base to tailor the model to our specific task of pneumonia detection.

Compile and Train the Model: The model is compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function and trained on the chest X-ray dataset.

Evaluate the Model: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
